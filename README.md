# KickStarter on Blockchain

## What is it

This is a decentralized Kickstarter built on Ethereum. The current kickstarter requries a centralized authority to store the contributions. With a smart contract deployed on Ethereum, the centralized platform can be replaced. This project is built following along this [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/). 

## Use Cases

Create a campaign for users to donate ethereum to. You can set the minimum amount for donations. Only people who have donated can be approvers of the campaign.

## Requirements

This project connects to the Ethereum test net Rinkeby. And interacts with Rinkey via Infura. 
Download MetaMask Chrome Extension ([link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en)) and create an account. 

Replace my web3 12 word seed with yours. ( Mine has no ethereum stored in it, it was purely used for this development :slightly_smiling_face: )

## How do I run it

```sh
git clone https://github.com/whhsu2/kickstarter-blockchain.git

npm install 

npm run dev
```
